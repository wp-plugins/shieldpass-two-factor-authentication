This plugin adds shieldpass two-factor authentication using access cards for different WordPress admin access users into the Wordpress login page.

== Description ==

ShieldPass is a highly secure two factor authentication system based on the http://www.passwindow.com authentication method. Users buy a low cost ShieldPass access card from https://www.shieldpass.com with a secret unique visual key. 
Once the plugin is configured and after the username and password is enter the user will be prompted to enter a dynamically changing one time password after superimposing their access card on the screen of their computer or mobile device.

The same shieldpass access card can be configured by the user to work in multiple online access points such as other blogs or websites including joining the growing ShieldPass secured client networks.

The ShieldPass transaction authenticated challenges are constructed in such a way so as to reduce the information loss from each challenge so that even a long term hacker analysis of the challenges and responses will fail to give an attacker enough information to determine the secret key pattern, leaving a hacker with no online attacks against the method commonly utilized against other authentication systems such as the infamous man-in-the-middle attack.

The simplicity of the method eliminates hi-tech hacking methods which bypass software authentication and electronic hardware authentication such as mobile based two factor authentication.

ShieldPass has the convenience of always being able to work even when travelling, out of mobile range or in a different country where the user does not have their mobile network. It also works equally well on any device with a normal display using an ordinary browser which can display the challenge image. Plus they fit securely in an ordinary wallet or purse with your normal id cards. 

The access cards contain no electronics or limited lifespan and can be relied upon in the most rugged conditions where normal electronics will fail.

Card costs and subscription are less than $10 and postage anywhere in the world is included in the price.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How do I get started with ShieldPass? =

Before installing the plugin, you'll need to buy a cheap ShieldPass access card at https://www.shieldpass.com

= Where do I configure the shieldpass plugin? =

The ShieldPass configuration panel is found under "Users" on the left hand side of the admin panel. 

= What makes this more secure than mobile sms authentication? =

What makes ShieldPass more secure is its simplicity eliminates the hi-tech attacks used against token and mobile authentication.
Mobile authentication is vulnerable to malware the same as the computers it is sopposed to protect however there are many other alternative attacks on mobile authentication most commonly used including simply calling the targets telecom provider and requesting all of your calls be forwarded to the hackers mobile. Also GSM encryption is now considered broken with kits available to decrypt sms messages.

= What makes this more secure than OTP token authentication? =

OTP hardware tokens often issued to protect bank accounts as well as USB OTP tokens are also vulnerable to malware performing a man-in-the-middle attack whereby the malware passes the OTP value from the user to their own hidden connection. While not implemented into this plugin version ShieldPass has the ability to perform transaction authentication whereby specific authentication information is passed along with the OTP challenge thereby defeating a MITM attack.

= Could malware analyze the challenges to try to determine the key? =

No, we assume the worst and introduce enough entropy into the visual challenges to make analysis practically impossible for malware.

= WordPress integration is great, but what if I want to protect my own web applications with ShieldPass two-factor? = 

If you're interested in protecting other web applications with ShieldPass's two-factor authentication, simply cut and paste the html code in your client account for easy integration with other web applications.
